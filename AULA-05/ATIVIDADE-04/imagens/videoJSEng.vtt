00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.400
Once upon a time, there is internet.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.849
You know, a bunch of computers
all connected by wires.

3
00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.389
One person on a computer
can read documents

4
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.449
from another person's computer
using a language called HTML.

5
00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.960
Each computer's web browser
can properly display these documents.

6
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.370
Add success to the mix, and you've got
a beautifully styled web page.

7
00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.389
It is important to note
that neither HDMI out

8
00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.920
nor CSR programming languages.

9
00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.529
Back in 1995, a few people at Netscape
started to wonder what

10
00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.849
if there was a way
to write a computer program

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.400
for the browser?

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.700
This way, when HDMI access gets sent
from one computer to another,

13
00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.939
you can also send over some programs.

14
00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.880
All this code
would run in someone's web browser

15
00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.590
and create an even better user experience.

16
00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:49.529
Thus, JavaScript was born.

17
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.290
You're probably familiar with Twitter.

18
00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.659
They use a lot of JavaScript
on their web page

19
00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:58.080
to do things such
as opening up a tweet in a bigger window,

20
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.340
for instance.

21
00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:03.790
Also, any of the actions below a tweet
will trigger some JavaScript to be run

22
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.930
if I click the star to favorite a tweet.

23
00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:08.669
JavaScript will tell the server.

24
00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:11.910
This tweet is now a favorite
if I click on reply.

25
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.800
You can see the JavaScript behavior
at work yet again.

26
00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:17.730
It focuses on the expanded reply box.

27
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.160
All of this behavior
is made possible by JavaScript.

28
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.480
It's worth mentioning
that Java is not JavaScript.

29
00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.449
They are two separate
programming languages.

30
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.750
JavaScript is not just for programming
in the browser,

31
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.269
but on servers, game programming databases
and even robots.

32
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.340
Robots are only limited
by our imagination.

33
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.700
Are you excited yet to get started?

34
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.190
If you're new to these parts,
please take a moment to play

35
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.709
through our free five minute tutorial
on JavaScript, Gqom,

36
00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.319
or you can head over
to our Getting Started page,

37
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.840
where we've curated a list of free places
to learn on our news page.

38
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.010
You can submit your own JavaScript news.

39
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.730
Read what other people have posted.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.330
Subscribe to our weekly newsletter
or listen to our podcast.

41
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.869
Welcome to the wonderful world
of JavaScript.

42
00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.949
We hope you enjoy your stay.

43
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.979
Awesome. Let's try it.
